# Day 2 – Python Operators

## Covered Topics
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, //, **
- Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical operators: and, or, not
- Identity operators: is, is not
- Membership operators: in, not in
- Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

## Notes
- `%` gives remainder → useful for even/odd check.
- `//` gives floor division (integer result).
- `is` checks if two variables point to same object in memory.
- `in` checks if value exists inside a sequence.

## Reflection
Today I revised operators and built a **Unit Converter Project**.
