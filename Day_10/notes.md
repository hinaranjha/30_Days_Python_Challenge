# Day 10: Lambda, Map, Filter, Reduce

### lambda
* **Anonymous function:** → means it has no name (unlike def my_function(): ...).
* **Takes multiple arguments:** → yes, you can pass many inputs.
* **Performs one task (one expression only):** it can only contain a single expression, not multiple statements.
* Automatically returns the result of that expression (no need for return).
```bash
lambda arguments: expression
lambda x : x * x
```
#### Syntax: The basic syntax is lambda arguments: expression.
```bash
lambda: The keyword indicating a lambda function.
arguments: The input parameters the function takes (can be zero or more).
expression: The single expression that is evaluated and returned.
```


### map
```bash
map(function, iterable)
```



### filter
```bash
filter(function, iterable)
```



### reduce
```bash
reduce(function, iterable)
```
