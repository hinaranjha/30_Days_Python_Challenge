# Day 4: Conditionals

Itâ€™s a way to make decisions in programming.
It checks conditions in order, and only one block of code will run.
Conditionals are the statements in programming that let you make decision
They check whether the condition is **True** or **False** then execute the code.

<!-- If it's raining today. Then i'll take umberalla. Otherwise i won't -->


## The structure of conditionals in python

if condition1:
    # runs if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
elif condition3:
    # runs if above are False AND condition3 is True
else:
    # runs if none of the above conditions are True

## Why are conditionals important?
* They let your code make decisions instead of always running the same way.
* Used in games, apps, data analysis, and almost everything in programming.
